# Dynamic_Instruction_Scheduling
Simulator for out-of-order superscalar processor based on Tomasulo's algorithm.

For this project I had constructed a simulator for an out-of-order superscalar processor based on Tomasuloâ€™s algorithm that fetches, dispatches, and issues N instructions per cycle. Only the dynamic scheduling mechanism will be modeled in detail, i.e., perfect caches and perfect branch prediction are assumed.

For more detailes please see the instructions file.
